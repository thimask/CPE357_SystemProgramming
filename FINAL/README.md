Write a high performance program to sort an array of numbers!
In fact, write two programs! Program 1 calls program 2 several times. Program 1 should share the
work with its copies over shared memory.
The syntax will be:
./mympi myprogram* n
*could be either name
With n being a number between 1 and 16 in binary terms (1,2,4,8,16). Your program must work
with all of these inputs.
